        <p>The development of VLIZ's data systems has been marked by several key milestones. 
        In 2000, the Integrated Marine Information System (IMIS) was launched, connecting individuals to institutes, publications, projects, datasets, and maps. 
        In 2005, the Open Marine Archive (OMA) was introduced, providing digital access to a vast literature collection. This system has become a vital resource for marine scientists and researchers, with 1,795 requests handled in 2023—95% of which were answered within a day. Another significant achievement was VLIZ's involvement in EU-funded programmes. The MarBEF project led to the creation of an EU register for marine species, which evolved into the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), and the development of the VLIMAR Gazetteer, later known as 'Marine Regions'. These initiatives paved the way for the launch of additional databases through various European projects.
        <p>The presence of several prominent international organizations within the VLIZ buildings highlights the institute’s significance in the marine data landscape. In 2005, the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) project office, part of UNESCO-IOC, relocated to VLIZ. The Ocean Teacher Global Academy (OTGA) training programme and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) also made VLIZ their home, with VLIZ contributing to OBIS in Europe. In 2013, VLIZ became the host of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) secretariat. In this role, VLIZ was tasked by the Flemish government with developing the central web portal, which provides users with access to a wide range of data offered by EMODnet.</p>

<p>Initially, VLIZ focused on managing international biodiversity data. In 2002, the institute launched its own time series of abiotic data from the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS), through measurement campaigns onboard the research vessels Zeeleeuw and Simon Stevin. VLIZ’s international scope expanded further in the wake of the 2004 tsunami in Asia, when VLIZ partnered with GLOSS to coordinate the web portal for sea level measuring stations worldwide.

As VLIZ took on the role of data manager in various international partnerships, its data systems, including IMIS, grew systematically. The integration of the international research infrastructures LifeWatch and ICOS in 2012 further enhanced BPNS measurements, adding biotic data and greenhouse gas measurements. The data also became more diverse with the development of dedicated data portals such as <a href="https://www.scheldemonitor.be/nl">ScheldeMonitor</a>, 4DEMON, and <a href="https://www.vliz.be/projects/crestproject/nl/home-2.html">CREST</a>.

Since 1995, VLIZ has systematically monitored water quality, quantity, and wildlife in the Scheldt estuary. On behalf of the Flemish-Dutch Scheldt Commission, VLIZ manages the ScheldeMonitor website, providing public access to this data. Since 2004, the portal has also integrated data from the MONEOS programme (monitoring and research to support cross-border policy and management in the Scheldt estuary). Thanks to significant funding from the Flemish government, including contributions to European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) projects, VLIZ has made substantial investments in information and data management. Another notable project is the comprehensive research and monitoring programme, <a href="https://www.omes-monitoring.be/nl">OMES</a>.</p>

<h4>National role</h4>
<p>Data and Citizen Science: At VLIZ, the engagement of citizens in research activities (“<a href="https://www.vliz.be/en/what-we-do/ocean-literacy/citizen-science">citizen science</a>”) is fostered through projects that motivate locals (as well as visitors) to participate in data collection. An example is the Coast Snap Project where citizens collect data on coastal change by taking pictures of the beach at designated stations along the Belgian coast. Always taken from the same position (cellphone holder), these pictures provide time series data for the analysis of shifting shorelines and beach-dune dynamics (e.g. erosion and accretion).</p>

<h4>International role</h4>
<p><strong>VLIZ in the Ocean Decade:</strong>: As an implementing partner of the Ocean Decade, VLIZ plays an active role in advancing its goals. Many of the endorsed “Actions” — including projects, activities, programmes, and contributions. These include: <a href="https://www.marinespecies.org/">WoRMS</a>, <a href="https://www.eurobis.org/">EurOBIS</a>, <a href="https://northsearegion.eu/geans/">GEANS</a>, <a href="https://www.europeantrackingnetwork.org/en">ETN</a>, <a href="https://oceantrackingnetwork.org/">OTN</a>, <a href="https://www.icos-cp.eu/">ICOS</a> and <a href="https://www.marineregions.org/" mia-extra-properties="nochange">Marine Regions</a>.</p>
